Fry Bread

## What you need

**Ingredients**

- 1 cup buttermilk
- 2 cups self-rising flour
- vegetable oil (as needed)

## Equipment
- thermometer
- frying pan

**Instructions**

1. Mix self-rising flour with buttermilk in a bowl (dough will be very sticky).
 
2. Knead bread for 2 minutes then let set for 3 minutes.

3. Scoop up about 1/4 cup of dough and gently pat into a 5-inch circle on a well-floured work surface.

4. Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet until a deep-frying thermometer placed in the center of the oil, not touching
the bottom, reads 360F. Gently place a dough circles into the hot oil and fry until golden 
brown on both sides, turning once, about 3 minutes per side. Fry bread will expand in size as it cooks. Drain the fried 
bread pieces on paper towels and place on baking sheets. Transfer to the oven to keep warm while you finish frying the 
bread.
