Pizza dough
============

*makes two 12 inch pan pizzas*

**Ingredients**   
- 1 cup warm water (not hot or boiling)
- 2 teaspoons active dry or instant yeast
- 300 grams bread flour
- 80 gram mix all-purpose flour and semolina (50/50)
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon olive oil

**Instructions**
1. Mix the water, yeast, salt, sugar, and olive oil. Stir and then let the mixture sit for about five minutes until the yeast is 
dissolved. 
2. Add 325 grams flour. Stir until a shaggy dough is formed. Cover dough and let sit at room temperature for 2 to 24 hours.
2. Sprinkle a little of the extra flour mixture onto your clean work surface and turn out the dough. Knead the 
dough for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from 
sticking to your hands or the work surface, but try to be sparing. It's better to use too little flour than too much.
3. Let the dough sit for another hour. Spread with fingers for bigger bubbles.


### Tips.
* Bake pizza's at 450f in cast iron using either olive oil or corn meal. If using Italian 00 flour bake at 500.   
* After adding sauce and cheese sprinkle with italian seasoning or oregano.  
* Brush edge of crust with olive oil and cover with fresh parmesan cheese before baking.  
* Instead of tomato sauce use olive oil. After baking add chunks of ricotta and pesto.
