Pizza dough
============

*makes 12 inch pan pizzas*
## What You Need  

**Ingredients**   
- 1 cup warm water (not hot or boiling)
- 2 teaspoons active dry or instant yeast
- 2 1/2 - 3 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 1-2 teaspoons olive oil (optional)

## Equipment

- Mixing bowl
- Rolling pin
- Cast iron skillet (for stovetop baking)
- Baking sheet or a baking stone (for oven baking)

**Instructions**
1. Form the pizza dough: Mix the water and yeast together, and let sit for about five minutes until the yeast is 
dissolved. Add 2 1/2 cups of the flour (saving the last half cup for kneading), salt, sugar, and olive oil (if using).Stir 
until a shaggy dough is formed.

2. Knead the Dough: Sprinkle a little of the extra flour onto your clean work surface and turn out the dough. Knead the 
dough for about 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed to keep the dough from 
sticking to your hands or the work surface, but try to be sparing. It's better to use too little flour than too much. 
If you get tired, stop and let the dough rest for a few minutes before finishing kneading.

3. Let the Dough Rise: Clean the bowl you used to mix the dough and film it with a little olive oil. Set the dough in 
the bowl and turn it until it's coated with oil. Cover with a clean dishcloth or plastic wrap and let the dough rise 
until it's doubled in bulk, 1-2 hours.
