Toum
===========

```
This is not hard to make, but there are a few things you need to do or it won't work. 
The process that makes the oil "mix" is called emulsification.

Make sure all your work surfaces, blender, and any bowls you use are dry. 
Seriously not a drop of water.
All of your ingredients should be room temperature.
Pour the oil very slowly.
```

**Ingredients**
- 1 tbsp salt
- 5 cups vegetable oil
- 3 bulbs of garlic (room temperature)
- Lemon juice from 1 lemon (You have to squeeze this yourself, don't use anything from concentrate it will break the emulsification process)

**Instructions**

1. Peel the garlic completely and chop it very fine.
2. Put salt and garlic into a blender and run it for a few seconds.
3. Next you will slowly add the oil and run the blender on low.
    - Very slowly pour the oil in a very thin stream in half cup increments.
    - Between each half cup increment add 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.
    - You will have to stop the blender every once in awhile to scrape the sides of the blender back down
4. When you have 2.5 cups of oil remaining you will probably want to move to a bowl because the blender won't work any more. Just continue to pour oil very slowly in half cup increments separated by 2 tbsp of lemon juice all while stirring vigorously.
5. Once all the oil is gone if you have any remaining lemon juice just pour it in and mix it well.
6. You now need to cool the toum down so cover the bowl with a paper towl and put it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. You need to use a paper towl because if you use anything water tight water the water that condenses in the bowl will be enough to separate the oil.
7. After 20 minutes you can put a tight cover over the bowl and it will last for about a month.
